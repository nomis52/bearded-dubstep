Two implementations are included, one that uses the OS serial port driver,
the other uses libusb directly.

# Serial Port (serial.cpp)

This uses the host's CDC driver, and accesses the device as if it were any other seiral port.

Advantages:
* Cross platform, pretty much every OS should have a CDC driver

Disadvantages:
* Can't access the USB serial number
* Can't reset the device.
* Have to scan all serial ports looking for possible widgets.

# Libusb (libusb.cpp)

This looks for the device 

Some platforms (Mac) won't allow libusb to detatch the kernel driver, so I had to change the USB class
code so that the USB device wouldn't show up as a CDC device. 

On Linux, we'd have to set a udev rule to prevent the ACM driver from claiming the device.

Advantages:
* Can reset the device using libusb
* Can access the device's serial number
* We know exactly what device to look for.

Disadvantages:
* Have to change the USB Device code if you want to
